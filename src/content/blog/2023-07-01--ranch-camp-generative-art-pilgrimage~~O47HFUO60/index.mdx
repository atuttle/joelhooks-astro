Since 2011 I've been making an annual trip to Aspen Colorado to spend a week in the mountains at the beautiful Anderson Ranch Art Center for a week long workshop with generative art pioneer, The Dark Wizard of Processing, Joshua Davis.

The first year was cool. We were using Flash at the time, and it felt like such a release to be coding creatively after spending the majority of my year building various configurations of lists and forms. Using code to make things move on screen and build **art** feels really fuckin good, so I kept coming back.

Flash died, but thankfully the Processing programming language and ecosystem provided a path forward, and Josh brought the same level of "fuck ya!" and decades of experience building complex visual systems to that environment.
